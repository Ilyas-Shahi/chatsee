# Chatsee

### Real-time Chat app with File Sharing.

Built on MERN stack. Using Socket.IO for real-time chatting and WebSockets. Using MongoDB for database, and Firebase Storage for file storage, and JWT for auth. On the front end, we're using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS to make things look good and run smoothly and using Zustand for state management. We organize everything in one place with Yarn workspaces.

Still under development...
